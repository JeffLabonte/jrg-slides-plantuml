A plantuml reveal-js slide show.

Currently only available *en fran√ßais*.

This might come to act as a scaffolding project for subsequent presentation.


Entering the reproducible environment
-------------------------------------

```bash
$ cd /path/to/this/repo
$ nix-shell
# ..
```

The previous steps require [nix].


Building and previewing
-----------------------

## Reveal-js output

```bash
$ cd /path/to/this/repo
$ make revealjs
# ..
$ firefox ./slides-revealjs.fr.html
```

A convenience target is also provided to do the same:

```bash
$ make revealjs-and-preview
# ..
```


Vscode
------

Also, if using *vscode*, make sure to launch it from within the nix environment:

```bash
$ code .
# ..
```

This will allow for the task we setup in `.vscode/tasks.json` to proceed correctly.

 -  `Ctrl + Shift + b`: runs `make revealjs`.
